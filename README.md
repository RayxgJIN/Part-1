# Test Results Part 1

## Overview

This repository contains the literature review and test results related to Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) and Hamiltonian Neural Networks (HNN) methods for efficient Bayesian inference.

## Contents

- **File: [Report 1.pdf](./Report%201.pdf)**  
  Contains the literature review of HMC and HNN methods, along with test results based on Question 1.

- **Folder: [TensorFlow](./Tensorflow)**  
  Includes implementation code for HMC and HNN using TensorFlow.
  **Note:** Try running `hmc.ipynb` or `hnn.ipynb` first! These notebooks contain the exact code needed for this question  using TensorFlow.

- **Folder: [PyTorch](./Pytorch)**  
  Contains implementation code for HMC and HNN using PyTorch, based on the code from Question 1.
